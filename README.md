Software support for documentation of large and complex software projects

When managing large and complex software projects, it is often necessary to access information in varying contexts to answer questions such as:

* what has changed in a particular artifact between two versions?
* what changes have been made in a business process between two versions?
* which artifacts are used by a particular business process?
* which business processes use a particular artifact?
 
If this information is not readily available in a structured form, IT staff will end up spending up to 90% of their working hours trying to collect this information, and fixing defects which would not have been made if the information had been available.

xDoc stands for "extreme documentation". It provides a technical platform for collecting, storing and accessing all forms of information concerning specification of and changes to software.

xDoc includes integrated modules for

* Business process requirements and specification
* Test specification and management
* Full version documentation
* Version delta documentation
* Impact analysis for changes to artifacts
* Impact analysis for changes to business processes
* Mapping between business data, technical data and database data
